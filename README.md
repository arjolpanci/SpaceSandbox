# Space Sandbox

/// Currently suspended/abandoned due to heavy daily workloads, may resume again at some point in the future. ///

This project is an attempt to simulate a micro procedurally generated universe. The features of each celestial body are randomly generated depending on their position on the world space.

The project uses Unity for the game engine, C# for scripting and Nvidia CG Language for the custom Shaders.

Currently supported celestial bodies are:
 - Earth-Like Planets (With atmospheric scattering simulation)
 - Moons (With craters)
 - Asteroids (Irregularly shaped)
 - Stars (Large light-emitting bodies)
